# ml-from-scratch
### **TL;DR**

This repository showcases my learning journey in the world of DS and ML. It is also meant to publicly share comprehensive and reproducible examples written in Python that are supported by digested theory collected through **hundreds** of different sources. Currently here you can find detailed information on: 
- classic ML (linear, logistic and softmax regressions, trees, SVMs)
- ds (A/B testing: frequentist and bayesian approaches)
- linalg (linear algebra concepts: svd)


###### <i>**friendly p.s.**</i> Imho it is the best way to understand and adopt complex mathematical concepts, that is through not only learning the theory but also coding them themselves, just like I did here. Thus I strongly encourage you to make such a repository yourself, because it **really** does help wrap your head around what is left untouched at universities and stay competitive as a DS or MLE.
